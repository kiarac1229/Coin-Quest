# Coin-Quest

Coin Quest is a multi-level game using a Platform and Top-Down format. I created this game in a HTML5-based 2D game editor called Construct3. 


The c3p file is the easiest way to view the full project and play the game. It can be opened in the Construct3 editor

     1. Download file

     3. Open from file
     4. Choose c3p file
